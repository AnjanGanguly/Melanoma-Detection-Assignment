# Melanoma-Detection-Assignment
## Problem Statement

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. This approach uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify nine types of skin cancer from existing images.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

The classes in the dataset are as follows:
